					My research centers on modeling the evolution of close binary star systems and connecting their
					observed properties to theory and the current populations of close binary systems. I develop
					physically motivated, data-driven models that integrate large astronomical surveys with detailed
					stellar and galactic simulations, with a focus on common-envelope evolution, chemically peculiar
					stars, and stellar evolution using the MESA framework. My work emphasizes forward modeling, Bayesian
					inference, and rigorous uncertainty quantification to link observations to theory.
				</p>
				<p class="mb-3 text-gray-700 text-justify">
					I lead and contribute to projects spanning the full research pipeline, from target selection and
					observing strategy to data reduction, statistical analysis, and high-performance computing. This
					includes building scalable workflows for survey and spectroscopic data, fitting multi-component
					disk–halo models to stellar populations, and developing reproducible computational tools for
					parameter estimation and model validation to extract robust physical insight from complex,
					high-dimensional data.

					As teachers, we influence more than just the direct education of our students. For some, we are
					their
					first introduction to higher education or a particular field. For others, we may be the last science
					course they take in their formal education. For hopefully a few, we may inspire them to pursue a
					lifelong
					career in our fields, which undoubtedly happened to each of us at some point. Whatever the outcome,
					students'
					interactions with their professors and classes undoubtedly leave a mark on their education and
					future.
					As such, it is imperative that we not only be their teachers, but also their mentors and guides, in
					exploring
					their education.
				</p>
				<p class="mb-3 text-gray-700 text-justify">
					My teaching philosophy centers around the idea that <B><em>students learn more effectively when they
							are
							engaged with the material and participate in their education.</em></B> The key here is
					constructing classes
					in such a way as to cover the typical material needed (think usual lectures of the needed concepts,
					equations, theorems, derivations) combined with example use of those principles, so students see
					and, most
					importantly, <em>do</em> the real-world analysis needed. My goal as an instructor is <B><em>to
							instill a
							sense of appreciation and confidence in students' science abilities and to give them the
							reasoning and
							analytical skills necessary to understand and partake in astronomy or physics.</em></B>
